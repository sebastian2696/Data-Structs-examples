# Lab09
In this lab, you are expected to create a directed graph by using given input files, which are generated by gen_graph.py and display the directed graph.

A directed graph consists of vertices that are connected together by edges, where edges have a direction associated with them.

For example:
```
		4
		^
		|
		|
		1 - - > 2 - -> 3
```
										 
is a directed graph consisting of four vertices, e.g., vertex 1, vertex 2, vertex 3, and vertex 4, and 3 edges.

We can also represent above graph in the following format:
```
1-> 2, 4
2-> 3
3-> NULL
4-> NULL
```

The instructions of functions, you are expected to finish, are given along with the code. Please read instructions carefully before you start to code.

We provide two test files for you to check your code. You can also use gen_graph.py to generate new test files. Please run it by using the command like this:

python gen_graph.py 5 10,

where 5 is the number of vertices, and 10 is the number of edges.
